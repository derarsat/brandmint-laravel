                        experience &amp; expertise in the field of branding, Design &amp; management. Elaborating on
                        Brandmint's unique Offering, she says:</p>

                    <p class="font-regular">Basically, we wanted to challenge the traditional branding model, making it more
                        customer-centric. Our years of experience in branding have allowed us to develop our very
                        own brand building framework. This frame work is based on our belief that brands are just
                        like people, they have a job to do.Using this framework, the team delivers strategic, agile
                        brand roadmaps instead of the traditional, restricting brand guidelines.</p>

                    <p>Raya was featured in the 2017 Leading Chief Executive Officer Award &amp; Most Trusted Chief
                        Executive Officer for Providing Outstanding Business Services in Lebanon. </p>
